#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It applies engineering principles to ensure software is reliable, efficient and easy to maintain. It is important because modern technology relies heavily on software to function effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Significant momentum was achieved when the NATO Science Committee organized two groundbreaking conferences in 1968 and 1969. 

In the 1980s, a new paradigm emerged that would revolutionize software development: object-oriented programming (OOP).

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning and requirement analysis – Gather requirements from stakeholders and analyze potential risks to set the foundation for the project.

Defining – Document all requirements in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for approval.

Designing – Create and evaluate multiple software designs, selecting the best one for development.

Development – Write code based on the design using appropriate programming languages and standards.

Testing – Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix bugs, ensuring the software meets quality standards.

Deployment and maintenance – Deploy the software, monitor for issues, and provide updates or fixes as needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall
Often hailed as a pioneer in the software engineering history methodologies, the Waterfall approach follows a step-by-step routine. One phase concludes before the next one begins, ensuring a systematic progression.Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government systems.

Agile
Agile stands out in the history of Software Engineering for its adaptive nature. It’s not just a methodology but a collection of best practices. It champions swift feedback, adaptability, and collaboration, making software development a dynamic dance.Ideal for software products that require frequent updates, like mobile apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Writes, tests, and maintains code.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer - Ensures the software meets quality standards through testing.

Project Manager- Oversees the project, ensuring deadlines and objectives are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments - Software that helps developers write and test code efficiently eg visual studio.

Version Control Systems (VCS): Tools that track changes in code, making collaboration easier eg GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging and Troubleshooting, debugging can be frustrating, but using unit tests, debugging tools, and collaborating with others helps fix issues faster.

Handling Tight Deadlines, tight deadlines cause stress, but prioritizing tasks, managing time well, and negotiating for more resources keeps you on track.

Complex Code Maintenance, maintaining complex code is tough, but good documentation, refactoring, and unit tests make it easier to manage.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing
Tests individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly and typically automated and performed by developers.

Integration Testing
Ensures that different modules or components interact correctly and verifies data flow and communication between integrated units.

System Testing
Evaluates the entire system as a whole against specified requirements and identifies issues related to system behavior and functionality.

Acceptance Testing
Validates the software against business requirements and ensures the system is ready for delivery to end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and fine-tuning prompts to obtain the desired responses from AI models. It's similar to asking the right questions to get the most accurate answers. The way a prompt is worded can greatly impact the AI's response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

For example if i ask Chatgpt for something and I say:
Vague prompt
Give me a variable that stores list of values
Improved prompt
Give me a variable that stores a  list of integer values in python

The improved prompt is more effective because it species the exact information I am seeking by giving me integer values in python. It provides clear direction for Chatgpt to focus on and making the response more relevant. The vague prompt is leaving Chatgpt to choose from a wide range if possible topics, resulting into less targeted information.
